 Junior Java Developer Skills Assessment was a good task to test the knowledge I gain.

 Task1: In this task, I learned how to set up my Java workspace correctly and how to make the most out of Git and GitHub.
 Task 2:Here I practiced using Java basics â€” variables, data types, methods, and the use of getters and setters.It helped me build a simple calculator using switch statements and understand the structure of a clean Java class.

 Task3: This task was really useful because arrays and strings are everywhere in real-world applications.
I got better at looping through arrays, reversing strings, counting words, replacing text, and more. These are all super practical skills.

Task 4: This was good practice for inheritance. I created a Book class and then extended it with a Textbook class.
I also worked with super() to call parent constructors and methods, and added custom fields in the child class. It gave me more confidence with class relationships and method overriding.

Task 5: was a good revision for dealing with nisted loops and creating some patterns and multiplication table;
Task 6: "Professional developers use Git every day." I learned new thing , How to create branches and organize my work space" , the important of git and commit my work.

----What I want to improve------
   - solving proplems better and smarter.
   - improve the speed of solving the problems.
